### Acknowledgement
* QualityAssessmentTools code incorporates the Checkstyle4BlueJ extension which can be found at https://github.com/MetroCS/checkstyle4bluej

* QualityAssessmentTools code incorporates the pmd-bluej extension which can be found at https://github.com/pmd/pmd-bluej

### Usage Instructions

#### Overview
This project is to provide an extension that can easily incorporate additional code quality tool extensions.
The main goal of this extension is to provide [BlueJ](https://bluej.org/) users the ability to check their code with code quality assessment tools. At the current stage, the QualityAssessmentTools extension provides Checkstyle and PMD, which helps BlueJ users write Java code that complies to a coding standards. 

Each tool in the current extension is modular to allow for easier addition and maintenance of individual quality assessment BlueJ tools.  

#### Requirements
* [BlueJ](https://bluej.org/) 4.1.X running on JDK 8 or higher.
* [PMD](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pmd/files/pmd/) latest version.

#### Downloads
The latest version of the QualityAssessmentTools can be found [on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/SoftwareExtensionRenovators/QualityAssessmentTools)
under QualityAssessmentTools-0.5.1.jar.

#### Installation Instructions
* Download the latest [QualityAssessmentTools-0.6.1.jar](https://github.com/SoftwareExtensionRenovators/QualityAssessmentTools/blob/master/QualityAssessmentTools-0.6.1.jar)
* Place the jar file in BlueJ's extension directory.
  * For Windows or Unix:
    * Navigate to a BlueJ directory
    * While in the directory, place QualityAssessmentTools-0.6.1.jar in lib/extensions
  * For Mac OSX:
    * Control+click BlueJ.app and choose Show Package Contents
    * Navigate to Contents/Resources/Java/extensions/
    * Place QualityAssessmentTools-0.6.1.jar in current folder
    * **NOTE:** If you are upgrading from previous version of Quality Assessment Extension or have any Checkstyle extensions active, remove your current checkstyle-extension-5.4.1.jar and any equivalents from the extension directory.

#### How to use
* In BlueJ, select **Quality Assessment Tool** from the **Tools** menu.
* Select **CheckStyle** from drop down menu **after compiling code**.
  * The extension uses its built-in [`default_checks.xml`](https://github.com/MetroCS/checkstyle4bluej/blob/master/docs/default_checks.xml) file unless you specify a different configuration file in Preferences.

  * To specify the Checkstyle configuration file or properties file:
    * Choose `Preferences...` from the `Tools` menu (or from the `BlueJ` menu under Mac OSX).
    * In the Preferences panel, click on the `Extensions` tab.
    * In the "Checkstyle" section, enter the file name for the checkstyle configuration XML file and/or properties file you wish to use.
* Select **PMD** from drop down menu:

  * To use PMD, download the current PMD update [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pmd/files/pmd/6.9.0). This version of this extension does not include PMD so you must install PMD under your operating system of choice. First step is to install PMD. You can install PMD from a prebuilt file or download it and build it yourself. Remember the path under where you have extracted the zip file, e.g. under Linux you could install it under ~/pmd-bin-6.9.0/. Under Windows it is usually most convenient to install PMD in the root so as to avoid spaces in directory names, (ie: Program Files) or PMD might not execute properly; the installation path could be c:\pmd-bin-6.9.0\.
  
  * After installing the Quality Assessment Extension in BlueJ, go to "Tools / Preferences / Extensions". Select or enter the    "Path to PMD installation" that you have remembered from step one above. You can also fine-tune the "PMD Options"; by default, the rulesets "java-quickstart" are executed.
  
  * Please see the PMD documentation for current rulesets available.
  
#### Ant Tasks

Use ant tasks to compile and build JAR file required to install the QualityAssessmentTools extension.  Navigate to directory where build.xml is stored:  
      
      $ ant       : compiles source code and builds project jar file. 
      $ ant clean : deletes all files and folders related to compiled code

#### Licenses

This extension utilizes several tools that come with their own licenses.  Licenses for specific tools can be found in their individual directories under [src](https://github.com/SoftwareExtensionRenovators/QualityAssessmentTools/tree/master/src/QAT/com/SoftwareExtensionRenovators/toolbox).
